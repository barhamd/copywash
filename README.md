# CopyWash

**CopyWash** is a tiny personal utility that strips formatting from macOS clipboard contents. Itâ€™s useful when you've copied styled text (e.g., from web pages, rich text editors, or ChatGPT) and want to convert it to plain text without bold, italics, or links.

## What it does

When you run `copywash`, it:

1. Grabs the current clipboard contents (formatted text)
2. Writes it to a temporary plain text file (removing formatting)
3. Reads it back in and replaces your clipboard with the plain version

## Installation

Clone or copy this repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/barhamd/CopyWash.git ~/path-to-your-utils-directory/CopyWash
```

Then make the script executable:

```sh
chmod +x ~/path-to-your-utils-directory/CopyWash/copywash
```

Add the folder to your PATH by editing `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/Work/CopyWash:$PATH"
```

Then reload your shell config:

```sh
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc
```

## Usage

Just run:

```sh
copywash
```

Your clipboard should now contain just the plain-text version of what you copied before.

## Example

Copy some formatted text:

```markdown
**Hello, world!** This is _formatted_ text.
```

Then run:

```sh
copywash
```

Then paste somewhere:

```txt
Hello, world! This is formatted text.
```
